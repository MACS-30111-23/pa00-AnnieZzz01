## Personal Reflection on Git/GitHub Workflow
First, I initialized my Git repository in my project directory. After that, I edited the README.md file using Markdown to include my biography and project details. Simultaneously, I created and edited script.py using Python to meet the project requirements. Once the editing process was complete, I committed all my changes to the main branch. Finally, I pushed the commits to my GitHub repository to ensure all changes were visible online and properly backed up. This process allowed me to keep track of my project changes efficiently and ensured a clean and organized workflow.


## Reflection on Using Markdown
Using Markdown to format the README has taught me how to build a well-structured document with simple syntax, and how to combine various elements such as links, lists, images, etc. in a clear and straightforward format. It's very easy to use, and I can do it locally through my terminal or GitHub.
